Install Development Environment
===============================

I use Ubuntu for Python development so that is what this development environment setup guide is written to, it should port easily to windows.

If you want to try Ubuntu on windows pain free, follow the guide `on ask ubuntu <http://askubuntu.com/questions/142549/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-virtualbox>`_. it's really easy to install and works great and this guide will be step by step so you can follow along.
